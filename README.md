# hello-world

hello frans,

Rahul here,Currently I am residing in gwalior (home town),
one of the great thing that I found here is  the people here are now more prefering cycles rather than cabs,or bikes,
so I feel. to introduce a cycle as a public tansport which means they can access it from wherever they want as ola or uber does.
by providing GPS or navigating app which gives them instant information about the location of the next cycle stand. from where they can access to it


Currently, there is one company  doing this name YANA but their contributions are not very much efficient, so by doing above task we can make it for efficient and affordable to each and everyone.

hope you will get it .

put your ideas together so that we can make it a success 

thank you.
